##### Hi there and thanks for stopping by!  My name is Brad, and I live in New Jersey with my wife Jennie, my son Andy, and two crazy cats named Blue and Patch.  I like to make stuff.  Lots of stuff.  I make furniture, remodel houses, do home DIY projects.  If you can take something apart with a screwdriver I probably have, and maybe fixed it, and then hopeefully put it back together.  I dabble in landscape architecture.  I make eggplant lasagna from scratch, using eggplant, tomatoes, and basil I grew in my own garden.  And most recently, I make software applications... :thumbsup:   


## My technical skills...
* JavaScript
* Other stuff... :grinning:

## What I did before coding...
* 10 years in the Construction and Property Management Industry
* 10 years in the Accounting/Finance Industry
